### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From France, I work on [PySMSBoxNet](https://github.com/Nardol/pysmsboxnet), a Python library [available on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pysmsboxnet/) to use [smsbox.net API](https://www.smsbox.net].

I also make some contributions to Home Assistant [core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) and [frontend](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend).

I also forked and updated a [Home Assistant Python script](https://github.com/Nardol/Nuki-MQTT-auto.-Discovery) to publish MQTT auto-discovery topics for the Nuki smartlock 3 pro and it should be the implementation officialy used by Nuki when MQTT will be publicly available.

My next objective is to contribute to [ESPHome](https://www.esphome.io) which I use daily.
